## USAGE

Each project has its own directory. The file structure is as follows:
    
**Project_Folder**
        |------ *.html assets
                          |--- css javascript images
                                  |       |       |
                              *.css   *.js  *.png *.jpg

Projects can be interacted with through launching the **'index.html'** file. The file structure is relative and no special tasks should be necessary to access the content in its completed form.

### Portfolio Site ('Module-1_Assessment')

The main HTML and CSS project is a portfolio site. The site consists of three pages: 'index.html', 'portfolio.html', and 'contact.html'. The content of the pages consists of an introduction, mock project portfolio, and a message submission form. The features are static in nature, though they do implement a degree of responsive design implemented using Bootstrap.

### Word-Guessing Game ('Module-2_Assessment')

The word-guessing game is implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Once started, the game is initialized via a key press by the player. Once initialized, a word - hidden to the player - is selected, and the player must guess the word within a specified number of turns. If the player wins or loses, the game can be restarted with a keypress.
